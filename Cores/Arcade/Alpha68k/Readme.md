# SiDi port of Alpha68k - Alpha Denshi M68000 arcade hardware

The intent for this core is to be a 1:1 playable implementation of [Alpha Denshi M68000 (ALPHA68K96V based) arcade hardware](http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=884).

Currently in beta state, this core is in active development by [Darren Olafson](https://twitter.com/Darren__O) with assistance from [atrac17](https://github.com/atrac17).

FPGA implementation has been verified against schematics for Sky Adventure. PCB measurements taken from Gang Wars (ALPHA-68K96V) and Sky Soldiers (ALPHA-96KII).

MiST port, new SDRAM controller, some fixes and enhancements by [Gyorgy Szombathelyi](https://github.com/gyurco) and [Gehstock](https://github.com/Gehstock).
