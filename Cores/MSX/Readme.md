# Installation #

The core requires an SD card formatted in FAT16 to work properly. You will also need to provide a few system files and utilities. You can find instructions on formatting SD cards on the [core's homepage](http://retroramblings.net/?page_id=917).

You can also use the following MSX Starter Pack to extract on a blank SD card formatted in FAT16.
It includes a few programs and the `MultiMente` file manager to easily browse files:

  * [MSX Starter Pack v0.5](http://newsdee.com/mist/msx_sd_card_0.5.zip)

Type "MM" (then Enter) to open the file manager, then select a .ROM or .DSK file and press Enter to run it.

Also support VHD hardfile image, for use in a FAT32 sd.
You can download VHD file here.
