Port from Mist to SiDi.
=======================

Mist and SiDi mount the same ARM, the only difference is the pinout distribution and the FPGA model.
SiDi mounts a FPGA Cyclone IV EP4CE22F17C8
To port a core from Mist to SiDi, you just have to change the FPGA model and the pinout, which can be done in the pin planner or directly in the .QSF file
In this link is the SiDi pinout.

I have also made a script for windows that does all the work automatically.

Unzip the file and place the two files in the same directory where the .QSF file is, then run mist2didi.bat and it will transform the QSF file from mist to the SiDi version, once converted open Quartus 13.1 or 17.X and synthesize the project.
Be careful modifying the QSF file while quartus is open, always run mist2sidi with Quartus closed.

For the SPI clock to work correctly in SiDi do not forget to declare the clock as GLOBAL
set_instance_assignment -name GLOBAL_SIGNAL "GLOBAL CLOCK" -to SPI_SCK

Normally with this simple process the cores work without problem, sometimes if it does not work it is due to the phase of the CLOCK_SDRAM, try to shift the phase of this clock.
